# Glanz-ImGuiParty

I create the gallery for ImGui visual effects made by tons of programmers.

On April 8th, 2025 I saw Imgui coding party ( <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/issues/3606">Click</a> ) and I want to test it myself then I create this compilation.
Note: I do not create any of the visual effect, just the gallery to hold 5 visual effects.

It is working on GFreya OS with ImGui 1.90.9, OpenGL 3.3 and GLFW.
